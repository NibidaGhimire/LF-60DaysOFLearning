**June 4**

Today I did around 20 simple exercises on numpy from  [jovian](http://jovian.ml).

I also got selected as an Executive/Creative Lead at IT Club Pulchowk.

I also gave DBMS assessment for which I revised:

**Data Abstraction & Independence, Data models, ER Diagram, Data Constraints, Normalization, etc.**
